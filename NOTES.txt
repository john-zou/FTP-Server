seems like it would all get printed to the control connection? 
listFiles should take the file descriptor of the accepted connection for the passive mode socket. (Remember, accept
returns a brand new socket file descriptor to use for this single connection.)

TA: You should send the 150, then the results of listFile(), then 226 Directory send OK.
