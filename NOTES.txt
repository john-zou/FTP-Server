> Am I suppose to be sending to the control connection because nlist is handling the pasv and nlst commands and it
seems like it would all get printed to the control connection? 
listFiles should take the file descriptor of the accepted connection for the passive mode socket. (Remember, accept
returns a brand new socket file descriptor to use for this single connection.)


> Do I need to send any message for the pasv connection establishing along with the 150 before sending the dir listing??

TA: You should send the 150, then the results of listFile(), then 226 Directory send OK.

1) Yes, pass the path after filtering for those 2 (remember .. is the same as ../, see @425 for more discussion on paths).
Remember ~/ is not allowed either - @447.
2) It should return 501 Syntax error in parameters or arguments when the number of
parameters is incorrect. But the above answer is also correct, ftp will not allow
you to send the command if you are missing a parameter for cd. (You can test this
using netcat, though.)
